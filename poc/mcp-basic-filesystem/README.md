# Filesystem MCP Demo
## Description
This project demonstrates how a large language model (LLM) can interact with your local filesystem using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The `mcp-client.py` script uses the Gemini model to create a 'hello_world.py' file and a new directory on your computer.

## Quick Start
```BASH
# Install `npm` referring to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
echo 'Install `npm` manually. It is not part of the script. You need to do it yourself.'
# Verify `npm` installation
npm
# Run the PoC demo
uv run mcp-client.py
```
